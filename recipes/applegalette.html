    <h1>Apple Galette</h1>
    <img src="apple.jpg">
    <h2>Apple Dessert</h2>
    <p>An apple galette features a simple yet rich combination of ingredients. The base is a buttery, flaky pastry dough made from all-purpose flour, cold butter, and a pinch of salt. The filling showcases fresh apples, typically a mix of tart and sweet varieties, such as Granny Smith and Honeycrisp. These apples are combined with sugar, a hint of cinnamon, and a touch of lemon juice to enhance their natural flavor. The result is a beautifully rustic dessert that balances the sweetness of the apples with the richness of the buttery crust.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>    
<li>1 sheet puff pastry, rolled to 1⁄8-inch thickness</li>
<li>4 baking apples - peeled, cored, and cut into 1/3 inch thick slices</li>
<li>1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
<li>1/3 cup superfine sugar</li>
<li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>    
<li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>    
<li>¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>    
<li>⅛ teaspoon ground cloves</li>
<li>1 egg, well beaten</li>    
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li> the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Lay puff pastry onto a round pizza pan.</li> 
    <li>Mix apples and lemon juice together in a bowl until evenly coated; add sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. Toss to evenly coat apples. Spread apple mixture into the center of the puff pastry and fold edges of pastry toward the center. Brush the folded pastry edges with about 1/2 the egg.</li>
    <li>Refrigerate pastry-apple mixture for flavors and pastry to settle, about 10 minutes. Brush pastry with remaining 1/2 egg.</li> 
    <li>Place pan on the top rack of preheated oven and bake for 20 minutes. Give galette a 1/4 turn and lower heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking until pastry is lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool slightly before serving, about 10 minutes.</li>
